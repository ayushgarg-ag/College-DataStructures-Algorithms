# Data Structures & Algorithms

This repository includes a collection of my projects from Data Structures & Algorithms -- a course I completed during my Freshman Fall at Duke University.

### Class Summary
The course was designed to allow for analysis, use, and design of data structures and algorithms using an object-oriented language like Java to solve computational problems. The class emphasized abstraction principles including interfaces and abstract data types for lists, trees, sets, tables/maps, and graphs. Furthermore, I implemented and evaluated programming techniques including recursion, as well as conducted intuitive and rigorous analysis of algorithms.
